I was born in North Carolina, and currently, live in California. I have lived everywhere from Washington D.C. and Pennsylvania, to Okinawa, Japan. Many people would not enjoy this lifestyle at all because of the difficulties that come with moving around so often, but I love all of the opportunities that have come from the military community and wouldn’t change it for the world!

		I have a little brother, an older sister, and two dogs. I love to travel, go to the beach, and try anything new! I enjoy reading and being crafty, even though I am the least artistic person on this planet. I am in dire need of a new series to watch on Netflix, so if there are any good shows out there, go to the “contact” tab and let me know!</p>
