	<p>Currently, I am finishing my second semester as a freshman at the University of New Haven, located in West Haven, Connecticut. In my first year, I have made the Dean's List and maintained a GPA above a 3.7. I declared my major in Paramedicine and really enjoy the program that this University offers. As part of the experiential learning aspect of this school, I work as a volunteer EMT with American Medical Response and in the Yale-New Haven Emergency Department in order to practice the skills that I learned in the classroom and gain experience in the field. The first year of this program is dedicated to becoming a licensed EMT and by the time I graduate, I will be a certified paramedic.</p>

	<p>When working in the field, I communicate with patients, take their vital signs, control major life threats, and assist in administering various medications approved by a medical director. Although a lot of stress comes with being an EMT and working in such a high-speed environment, I am good at working under pressure and I really love what I do!

	<p>Along with my regular class schedule, I am also part of the Honors Program and the Rotaract Club. When I am not in the classroom or on the ambulance, I am also a member of the Womenâ€™s Lacrosse team. Through all of my involvement on campus, I have made many good friends and am making the most of my college experience. Go Chargers!!</p>
